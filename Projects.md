# The Road to DEF CON 33
Currently, [Leadership](https://dc916.com/Leadership) is reaching out to PoC's to get insight on what it would take to have DC916 as a part of DEF CON Groups at DEF CON 33.

# BSides Sacramento Revival
It seems BsidesSac has been abandoned based on their [webpage](https://bsidessac.org). As of now, [Leadership](https://dc916.com/Leadership) does not have the bandwidth to launch a local con. However, if there's someone in the group who's interested in taking on this effort [Leadership](https://dc916.com/Leadership)) will do what they can to help revive BSides Sacramento.

Beginning the revival would seem to [start here](https://bsides.org/w/page/12194160/OrganizeALocalBSides).
