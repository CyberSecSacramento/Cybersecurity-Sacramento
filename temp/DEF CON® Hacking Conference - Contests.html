<p class="abstract">Welcome to $$$$$_&lt;CAPTURE_THE_COIN&gt;_$$$$$! We’re bringing real-world payment hacking straight to DEF CON. This contest merges hardware hacking, cryptanalysis, mobile app forensics, physical security, and offensive security into one glorious, chaotic CTF. No system is sacred! If it moves, stores or processes money, it's fair game. </p>
<p>From magstripes to mobile wallets, POS systems to online banking, ATMs to NFC payments, if it touches money, we’re messing with it. Your mission: reverse, break, manipulate, and exploit—all in the name of exploration!</p>
<p>Expect challenges where you’ll clone, decrypt, spoof, MITM, inject, and maybe even get a card to spill its deepest, darkest secrets. Want to mess with a banking app? We got you. Think your RFID cloning skills are solid? Prove it. Ever wondered if you can bypass chip-and-PIN protections? Let’s find out!</p>
<p>So, whether you’re an RFID wizard, EMV cryptography nerd, API manipulator, or into dumpster diving, there’s a challenge here for you. You might not get rich, but you’ll have fun trying!</p>
<h4>Participant Prerequisites</h4>
<p>Registration is to be made on the website. Our content is accessible to all and includes challenges which don’t require equipment. We also have a range of equipment that is available for loan such as card readers. A laptop and Android phone is needed for some of the challenges.</p>
<h4>Pre-Qualification</h4>
<p>No pre-qualifier!</p>

<p class="abstract">“$unL1ght Sh4d0w5”: The Nirubi Challenge - Prove Your Might</p>
<p>In the realm of cybersecurity, the pursuit of excellence is a never-ending quest. It's time to put your skills to the test and prove your worth in the &quot;$unL1ght Sh4d0w5: The Nirubi Challenge&quot;. </p>
<p>In the spirit of DEF CON 33's theme of promoting openness and accessibility, we present a unique hacking challenge that flips the script on traditional black box contests. We provide you with a production-ready Linux system, complete with known vulnerabilities and a proof-of-concept (POC) exploit to get you started and then throw the gauntlet that will push your limits and make you think outside the box.</p>
<p>The Nirubi Mandate:</p>
<p>Nirubi, an ancient Tamil word meaning &quot;to prove&quot;, is more than just a concept - it's a way of life. It's about demonstrating your capabilities, showcasing your expertise, and rising above the rest. In this challenge, we invite you to embark on a journey of self-discovery, to test your mettle against the best, and to emerge victorious.</p>
<p>The Challenge:</p>
<p>Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to leverage the given vulnerabilities and POC to achieve remote code execution and unleash a ransomware attack on our target system. The twist? We'll be watching as you navigate not one, but two separate challenges:</p>
<p>Part 1: &quot;Sh4d0w5 Recon&quot; - Using the provided vulnerabilities and POC, expand on the existing exploit to deliver a payload that encrypts the contents of a specific file on the system. Show us your skills in taking the given information and turning it into a successful attack.</p>
<p>Part 2: &quot;$unL1ght Horizon&quot; - If you succeed in Part 1, you'll be invited to take on the same system, but this time, it will be fortified with a proprietary hardening technology. Can you adapt your approach and still manage to inject your payload and encrypt the target file?</p>
<p>The Prize:</p>
<p>The first contestant to successfully complete both parts of the challenge will take home a prize of $20,000. Will you be the one to shine $unL1ght into the Sh4d0w5 and claim victory?</p>
<p>What sets us apart:</p>
<ul>
<li>We're providing you with the vulnerabilities and a POC, giving you a clear starting point for your attack. </li>
<li>You'll be working with a fully disclosed system configuration, eliminating the guesswork often associated with black box hacking contests.</li>
<li>Our challenge is designed to separate those who merely know from those who can truly execute. We'll give you all the information you need - system configurations, vulnerability details, and more. But can you use that knowledge to outmaneuver our defenses and emerge victorious?</li>
</ul>
<p>Rules and Eligibility:</p>
<ul>
<li>Contestants must be 18 years or older to participate. </li>
<li>All participants must agree to our terms and conditions, which include rules for responsible disclosure and non-disclosure agreements. </li>
<li>The contest will be held during DEF CON 33, with specific dates and times to be announced.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Participant Prerequisites</h4>
<ul>
<li>Bring your own laptop and/or smart-phone/tablet </li>
<li>Bring ANY software tools you would need for hacking purposes. This includes an operating system (e.g, Windows/Linux) with Python, C/C++ compiler and associated binary analysis tools.</li>
</ul>

</p>

 <img class="post-image scale" src="../../images/defcon-33/logos/contests/cnt-5n4ck3y.webp" alt="logo for 5N4CK3Y" /> 

<p class="abstract">AND!XOR creates electronic badges filled with hacker challenges. We love doing this, especially coming up with unique ways for hackers to earn them. 5N4CK3Y is a vending machine hardware hacking project from AND!XOR. We retrofitted it into an IoT CTF based badge dispensing machine, bling and all. Find enough flags on our web hosted CTF platform, you get a 5N4CK3Y dispense code, punch it in, and a badge is vended to you! There are a variety of challenges to earn a badge as well others to continue working on the badge itself once obtained. These span from hardware hacking, reverse engineering, OSINT, network security, phreaking, wireless, and cryptography to name a few. There's a little bit of everything, so it's a perfect way to learn something at one of the many DEF CON villages and talking with people you meet, then attempt the CTF challenges to dispense a badge. Hardware hacking is our passion and we want people to learn on badges once they get them.</p>
<h4>Participant Prerequisites</h4>
<p>A computer, desire to learn, and make friends to beg, borrow, and steal from if you need a tool which you do not already own. Our challenges are multidisciplinary. While we will not give away what is required this year, tools participants have used in the past include: Computer, Ghidra, AFL, telephone, lock pick set, SDR, Flipper Zero, UART Adapter, FT2232 hardware debugger, chip clip, telephone parts, TV remote control, audio recorder, tracing paper, pencil, solder iron &amp; solder, hot air gun, exacto knife, lighter, ice from a Malört cocktail being sipped on by Lintile, copper wire, booze, and ramen. In short, any tools required for the CTF challenges can be obtained at DEF CON.</p>
<h4>Pre-Qualification</h4>
<p>Absolutely not, we invite maximum participation.</p>

 <img class="post-image scale" src="../../images/defcon-33/logos/contests/cnt-questioncube.webp" alt="logo for ? Cube" /> 

<p class="abstract">Redefining Boundaries, Enhancing Connectivity, Innovating Control—Aperture Inc. is dedicated to pushing the limits of innovation and is fully committed to providing a more secure environment to maintain our promise to our “customers.”</p>
<p>At the core of it all lies the ?Cube—a labyrinth of security, deception, and ever-evolving complexity. Our engineers have reinforced its defenses, rewritten its digital DNA, and expanded its capabilities in ways that should concern you. Buried within its depths are secrets—secrets that could unravel everything. Infiltrate, decode, and dismantle. But beware: the ?Cube—and those also working towards the same ultimate goal— don’t take kindly to outsiders.</p>
<p>For those who know—welcome back. You already understand what’s at stake. For those who don’t… well, let’s just say we hope you are quick learners...</p>
<p>You’re about to embark on an adventure—one that demands nothing less than absolute technical precision across the precarious domains of physical security, web exploitation, cryptography, and other puzzles designed to unravel your sanity.</p>
<p>Assemble your team. Choose your specialists wisely. Then step into the ever-tightening web technologies that define the ?Cube. Escape is optional. Success? Highly unlikely.</p>
<p>The first team to breach the center earns the title—simple, right? Of course, if the Cube remains unsolved (again), the team that clawed their way the furthest will be honored for their valiant struggle. And make no mistake—a struggle is guaranteed. Every step forward will demand effort more and more. Mistakes could be costly.</p>
<p>But don’t worry… the Cube is very patient. It can wait. Can you? Will others?</p>
<h4>Participant Prerequisites</h4>
<p>DEI or DIE. Diverse talents across multiple domains of knowledge are highly recommended. Some tools such as lockpicks, Chromebooks, and other RFID tools may be available for various challenges, but it is recommended teams come prepared.</p>
<h4>Pre-Qualification</h4>
<p>The contest will not require qualifiers for the first full day. Point requirements will be required to continue interacting with the ?Cube as the contest progresses.</p>

<p class="abstract">Adversary Village will be hosting &quot;Adversary Wars CTF&quot;, which is built around adversary attack simulation, offensive cyber security and purple team tactics.
Adversary War CTF centers around mimicking enterprise infrastructure and corresponding challenges. These challenges are meant to push the participants towards adopting various TTPs that adversaries and threat actors use within a definitive time frame. Adversary Wars would have real world simulation CTF scenarios and challenges, where the adversaries can simulate attacks and learn new attack vectors, cyber threat intelligence, threat actor profiles, TTPs, techniques, etc. There would be combined exercises which include different levels of adversary emulation.</p>
<p>As part of the Adversary Wars Capture-the-Flag competition a fictional city would be hosted virtually as a target for the participants. Like all cities, the Adversary city too would comprise of various infrastructure components including a hospital, bank, police station, fire station, army camp, city apartments, IT companies, university, government buildings, power plant, etc.</p>
<p>Each building will have a complex and realistic network infrastructure that includes a wide variety of components, including Windows/Linux systems, applications, industrial systems, Active directory, cloud environments, hybrid environments, and numerous other technology systems. A complex network of interconnected organizations, assumed to have been working properly, monitored by security operations center and cyber defense systems, supposed to be hackproof, until it wasn’t. One fine day, the adversary city was breached by a threat actor. A wide variety of attacks were carried out by the threat actor, in the end they decided to shut the city for good and infected the remaining systems with ransomware.</p>
<p>CTF participants will need to rely on cyber threat intelligence to gather more information on the threat actor, understand and collect various attack tactics, tools, and exploits used by the adversary group. The participants will have to devise possible attack paths used by the adversary group, then simulate these activities against the target city's various components to recreate and understand how deeply the threat actor group breached the city's infrastructure and computer systems.</p>
<p>To visualize the CTF environment, the contest area will feature a miniature model of the city made using interlocking-plastic-bricks. The breached components OR organization buildings will be physically marked in the city model as the CTF progresses. This will also assist visitors and observers in understanding the contest's progress and gaining insight into what is happening behind targeted cyber-attacks, cyberwar, etc.</p>
<p>Just like in previous years, winning teams in the CTF competition can expect fantastic prizes. Additionally, there will be complimentary hoodies (yes, the iconic adversary village hoodies), free t-shirts, cool stickers, village coins, badges, and various other swag for the village participants.</p>
<h4>Participant Prerequisites</h4>
<p>Just a laptop</p>
<h4>Pre-Qualification</h4>
<p>We are not planning to have a pre-qualifier.</p>

<p class="abstract">Welcome to the &quot;AI Art Battle&quot; Generative AI Art Contest!</p>
<p>This unique competition invites creative minds to dive into the world of artificial intelligence and art. The challenge is to craft the most imaginative prompts that will be used by generative AI models to create artwork.</p>
<p>Contestants will not be creating the art themselves; instead, they will focus on designing prompts for well-known topics that push the boundaries of creativity and innovation.</p>
<p>How It Works:</p>
<p>Select a Topic:</p>
<p>Contestants will choose from a list of random topics.</p>
<p>These could range from historical events, famous literary works, mythical creatures, futuristic landscapes, to iconic pop culture references.</p>
<p>Craft a Prompt:</p>
<p>Using their creativity, contestants will write a detailed prompt designed to guide AI models in generating original artwork. The prompts should be clear, imaginative, and offer enough detail to spark the AI's artistic capabilities.</p>
<p>Submission:</p>
<p>Each contestant will submit their prompt and the intended outcome.</p>
<p>AI Generation:</p>
<p>The submitted prompts will be fed into a generative AI art model, which will create corresponding artworks based on the prompts.</p>
<p>A random panel will determine who the winners are.</p>

<img class="post-image scale" src="../../images/defcon-33/logos/contests/cnt-bandcamp.webp" alt="Band Camp" />

<p class="abstract">Band Camp: Hacker My Music! is a hands-on contest that combines DIY hardware hacking and musical innovation. With this contest we aim to bring together hackers, makers, and others looking for a new experience to design and build their own instruments in a reproducible sharable manner. If that means repurposing unexpected common materials or making custom 3d printed instruments, or even custom sound-generating gizmos we're in! Whether you’re into 3D printing, upcycling old hardware, or discovering strange new ways to produce melodies, this contest will give hackers the chance to create and perform with instruments that break all the rules. It’s a fresh perspective on hacking because it isn’t just about cracking code or bypassing security — it’s about hacking sound, reimagining music hardware, and pushing creative boundaries. Who knows, maybe we'll get a new &quot;blue box&quot;. </p>
<p>We encourage participants to take advantage of whatever resources they have on hand—3D printers, microcontrollers, pre-prepared parts, or even random junk from the hardware store. If it's reproducable and makes music, we want to hear it! The ultimate goal here is to create an open library of new sounds that can be used freely by hackers for whatever their needs. Maybe the sounds made could even be hosted on media.defcon.org and opened up for other musicians/hackers to use royalty free.</p>
<p>Rules and Participation Requirements to be hosted at hackermymusic.com</p>
<h4>Participant Prerequisites</h4>
<p>Participants may sign up and make their instruments ahead of time, or they can make them on site. We will have access to the 3d printers in the maker community that I am bringing along for them to use. </p>
<h4>Pre-Qualification</h4>
<p>None.</p>

<p class="details">
</p>

<img class="post-image scale" src="../../images/defcon-33/logos/contests/cnt-sebotsbattle.webp" alt="Social Engineering Vishing Competiton" />

<p class="abstract">The future of social engineering is here. Piggybacking on the success of last year’s John Henry competition, the SEC has gone all-in on a first-of-its-kind competition. In Battle of the Bots: Vishing Edition, teams will develop AI-driven bots to place live vishing (voice phishing) calls, testing the limits of artificial intelligence in deception. By blending hacking, automation, and psychology, competitors will see whose AI bot can capture the most objectives from live human interactions. As AI continues to evolve, so do its applications in cybersecurity—this competition provides a unique opportunity for competitors and spectators to witness firsthand the current state of offensive AI capabilities manifested through social engineering vishing calls.</p>
<p>Whether you're competing or spectating, this event offers a rare glimpse into the future of hacking. Attendees will witness AI bots in real-time navigating conversations, persuading targets, and adapting their tactics—just like a human social engineer. Expect to learn about the strengths, weaknesses, and ethical considerations of AI-driven vishing and the defensive strategies needed to counter this emerging threat. Join us and see if AI is ready to take on one of hacking’s most human-centered techniques. </p>
<h4>Participant Prerequisites</h4>
<p>To successfully participate, teams will need a basic understanding of AI prompt engineering to develop and refine their AI-driven vishing bots. Competitors should be comfortable designing prompts that guide AI responses effectively while ensuring their bots can engage in dynamic conversations. Additionally, all participants must adhere to the competition’s Code of Ethics, ensuring that their AI interactions remain within ethical boundaries and comply with contest guidelines. While prior experience with AI-driven automation or social engineering tactics may be beneficial, it is not required .</p>
<h4>Pre-Qualification</h4>
<p>No, we do not. Unless you count opening up our “Call for AI Competitors” to select competing teams.</p>

<p>That's it folks! DOGE has canceled our gas infused multi-liquid rapid cooling technology research grant along with the rest of the NSF because why would we need science when we have Tesla and SpaceX. Elon daddy you're so big and hard, please give me some juice from your massive rocket to cool my beverage because it for sure hasn't gone to Mars. What do you mean you lost it? Trump has it where!? This is why you have a flared base on the rocket! How am I supposed to cool my beverage after China starts WW3 because Pooh bear can't stop obsessing over his nine dash sack? This is a disaster!</p>
<p>Its beverage chilling folks, the description is on the tin. But just in case the illiteracy rates have reached such a level that you can't read the name of the contest, here is a description you can't read either. </p>
<p>Je koelt het drankje dat we je geven in een rode solobeker zo snel mogelijk af tot 34 graden F. Je mag het drankje niet veranderen door het te mengen met ijs, droog of anderszins. Je mag een apparaat meenemen of je eigen apparaat bouwen op de conventie. Er wachten fantastische prijzen, voornamelijk wat ik heb liggen en niet mee naar huis wil nemen.</p>
<p>(You will cool the drink we give you in a red solo cup as quickly as possible to 34 degrees F. You may not alter the drink by mixing it with ice, dry or otherwise. You may bring a device or build your own at the convention. There are some great prizes waiting, mostly what I have lying around and don't want to take home.)</p>

 <img class="post-image scale" src="../../images/defcon-33/logos/contests/cnt-embeddedsystems.webp" alt="logo for Embedded CTF" /> 

<p class="abstract">Embedded systems are everywhere in our daily lives, from the smart devices in our homes to the systems that control critical infrastructure. These systems exist at the intersection of hardware and software, built to accomplish a specific task. However, unlike general-purpose computers, embedded systems are typically designed for a particular case of use and have limited resources. This makes them both challenging and fascinating to work with, especially from a security perspective. Often these disciplines are dealt with individually, but understanding the custom relationships between hardware and software is vital to performing security research on these devices.</p>
<p>The embedded device CTF contest is an exciting opportunity to explore the intricacies of these systems and test your skills in a competitive environment. Contestants are challenged to find vulnerabilities in the firmware or hardware and exploit them to gain access or control over the device. The contest offers a unique opportunity to explore embedded devices' inner workings and understand their design's security implications.</p>
<p>By participating in the contest, contestants can develop a deep understanding of how these systems operate and how to secure them against potential attacks. Additionally, the contest encourages participants to think outside the box and approach problems creatively, honing their problem-solving skills. The competition provides a valuable opportunity to network with like-minded individuals and a chance to learn from others in the field hands-on.</p>
<p>Overall, the embedded device CTF contest is an exciting and educational experience that showcases the unique challenges and rewards of working with embedded devices. With the increasing integration of technology in our daily lives, embedded devices are becoming more ubiquitous, making this contest relevant and worth checking out. Whether you're a seasoned security professional or just starting in the field, the contest offers a chance to learn, test your skills, and have fun in a dynamic and competitive environment.</p>
<h4>Participant Prerequisites</h4>
<p>Contestants will need to bring their own laptop for the competition. That is pretty much it! We will have switches at the tables for them to plug into as well as WiFi that they can connect to for the contest.</p>

<p class="abstract">With the rise of Gen AI, a lot of the security workflows are quickly evolving to leverage AI capabilities. To help the community keep up with those changes in a fun and interesting way we’d like to hold the first CTF focused on solving challenges by teaming up with AI. We spent the last 6 months designing unique challenges that are best solved with the help of AI in ways that are directly applicable to many SecOps tasks such as incident response and threat intel. Although this particular village is new, we participated in organizing prior village events, including the AI Security Village last year. We also have extensive experience about running CTFs, which is the topic of our village: e.g., members of our team have organized the main Defcon CTF in past years (with Order of the Overflow), and others (e.g., iCTF, Google CTF).</p>

<p class="abstract">What is Hack3r Runw@y?</p>
<p>Hack3r Runw@y challenges creative minds in the hacker community to reimagine fashion through the lens of hacking.  We're calling all glamorous geeks, crafty coders, and fashionably functional folks to dust off their soldering irons, grab their needles and threads, and unleash their inner designers.  Whether you're a seasoned maker or a coding newbie, Hack3r Runw@y has a place for you. Hint: You don't have to know how to program to make cool wearables.</p>
<p>What to Expect:</p>
<p>Participants will submit their creations prior to the event and then walk the runway during our allotted time at DEF CON. Audience should be prepared to be amazed by a runway show unlike any other. Like really.  Witness creations that push the boundaries of fashion and technology, showcasing the ingenuity and resourcefulness of the hacker community.  </p>
<p>Expect to see:</p>
<p>Smart Wear that Wows: Garments integrated with LEDs, microcontrollers, sensors, and other tech wizardry, creating dazzling displays of functionality and style.
Digital Design that Dazzles: Visually stunning pieces that use light, color, and texture to create captivating, passive designs.</p>
<p>Functional Fashion: Practical and stylish creations that solve real-world problems, from masks and shields to lockpick earrings and cufflink shims.</p>
<p>Extraordinary Style: Unique and expressive designs that push the boundaries of fashion, incorporating everything from 3D textures and optical illusions to cosplay and security-inspired patterns.</p>
<p>A Hacker Perspective on Fashion:</p>
<p>Hack3r Runw@y brings a unique hacker perspective to DEF CON by demonstrating the power of creativity and problem-solving in a non-traditional context.  It showcases how hacking can be applied to art and self-expression, blurring the lines between technology, fashion, and culture.  It's about more than just making cool gadgets; it's about pushing boundaries, challenging conventions, and exploring the intersection of technology and human experience.</p>
<p>What You'll Learn:</p>
<p>Hack3r Runw@y offers attendees a glimpse into the creative potential of the hacker community.  You'll see firsthand how technical skills can be combined with artistic vision to create truly unique and innovative designs.  You'll be inspired by the ingenuity and resourcefulness of the participants, and you might even pick up some ideas for your own projects.  It's a chance to learn about new technologies, see them applied in unexpected ways, and connect with a community of like-minded individuals. Hack3r Runw@y teamed up with the DC Maker Community during DEF CON 32 to offer a workshop on sewing LEDs to clothing. Look out for something similar this year. </p>
<p>The Competition:</p>
<p>Participants will compete in four categories for a chance to win in each, plus the coveted People’s Choice trophy, where anyone can win, but there will be a twist!  Our esteemed judges will select winners based on:</p>
<ul>

<p class="details">
</p>

 <img class="post-image scale" src="../../images/defcon-33/logos/contests/cnt-hrvfoxhunt.webp" alt="logo for Ham Radio Fox Hunt" /> 

<p class="abstract">The last surviving fragments of Project ACCESS, a defunct open comms initiative, have resurfaced. The faceless OmniCorp thought they had erased it from the spectrum, but rogue operatives are pushing back. Disguised among the DEF CON crowd, Foxes are carrying the pieces needed to reboot the system.

They're broadcasting open signals across the con space. Your job? Track them down, follow the trail, and recover the payloads. Some Foxes are stationary. Others are on the move. All of them have something you need—but they won't just hand it over. You'll have to answer DEF CON trivia, solve puzzles, or earn their trust in creative ways.

This isn't a gear-only hunt. Whether you're rocking SDRs, handheld radios, or just tuned into the right frequency, you've got a shot. It's part signal chase, part real-world scavenger hunt, and 100% hacker weirdness.

    Expect:</p><ul>
    <li>Live human Foxes broadcasting short-range signals</li>
    <li>Some Foxes roaming the con floor hunt them down, respectfully</li>
    <li>DEF CON history questions, crypto puzzles, and maybe a social engineering twist or two</li>
    <li>Physical items or clues exchanged when you succeed</li>
    <li>No encryption. No gatekeeping. Just old school radio and clever chaos.</li>
</ul>
<p>Think you can track the signal, crack the code, and restore the last breath of open access?

Then grab your gear, tune in, and start hunting.
</p>
<h4>Participation Requirements:</h4>
<p>RF Fox Hunt(s): To participate in the RF fox hunt(s), you will need a radio or scanner that can receive signals in the 2m and/or 70cm Amateur Radio Bands (144.000 MHz - 148.000 MHz, 420.000 MHz - 450.000 MHz).</p>

<p class="abstract">This event was born out of the desire to teach an often-overlooked hardware and networking skill, and to provide the opportunity for experienced people to mentor others as they learn. DEF CON provides the perfect environment for people with no prior training to learn something useful and new. Hardwired networks are often overlooked in today's world of cellular connection and Wi-Fi, but they still play an important part in the backbone of information sharing.

<p class="abstract">Phish Stories is a contest that combines the art of creative writing with the strategic challenge of social engineering, inviting participants to craft phishing emails that are both convincing and hilariously entertaining. It gives people at any level the chance to show off their skills in writing, social engineering, and humor to create a unique contest that allows for multiple ways to win. Writers, comedians, and Red-Teamers can all find a path to victory!</p>
<p>Participants are tasked with creating phishing emails targeting fictional company leaders. The goal is to produce emails that are not only convincing enough to prompt a click but also funny enough to entertain. Contestants must also provide a one-page backstory that gives the details of the approach and what happens after our unsuspecting company leader clicks on that link. Contestants receive background information on their targets to help craft their entries.</p>
<p>There are three winners in the contest.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Ruler: Best overall combination of clickability and humor.</li>
<li>The Wizard: Best technical and clickable email.</li>
<li>The Jester: Funniest entry.</li>

<p class="abstract">Ever wondered what hacking looked like in the golden age of phone phreaking? What about today? What can we learn about the old techniques that still plague our current infrastructure? The Hacked Existence PhreakMe Capture the Flag (CTF)  brings the classic art of telecom exploitation into the modern era.</p>
<p>The Hacked Existence team is once again hosting a telecom based CTF. The CTF runs on real live VoIP lines routed through a modified asterisk PBX allowing participants to dial in to the CTF from a real world routable telephone phone number. This number is live 24/7 throughout DEF CON, allowing you to hunt the PBX for flags any time, day or night. Also there's a BBS this year and more telecom challenges. The flags are based around historically accurate tactics, techniques, and procedures to manipulate emulated old school switching systems.</p>
<p>The purpose of our contest is to bring awareness around the still existing weaknesses in our telecom infrastructure and Interactive Voice Response Systems. Ideally visitors to our contest area will participate in the CTF allowing them to get a better understanding of telecom hacking in the year 2024 as well as a respect for the art of phreaking from yesteryears.</p>
<p>Come test your skills, challenge your knowledge, and dive deep into the world of phreaks.</p>
<h4>Participant Prerequisites</h4>
<p>A phone, or access to a phone that can dial an american based phone number. The BBS will be both accessible from a modem and also ssh. Ideally people will read books like 'The Cyberthief and the Samurai' and 'Masters of Deception: The Gang That Ruled Cyberspace' and the Cult of the Dead Cow book. </p>

<p class="abstract">The Pinball High Score contest at DEF CON will run Friday and Saturday: 10:00-18:00, Sunday 10:00-13:00 with games available for daily High Score contests, daily challenges and open qualifying for a main tournament. The daily contests will allow any attendee to play pinball games and attempt to record a qualifying high score on each of the unique games. At 17:00 on Saturday main tournament qualifying will end, tiebreakers will be played(if needed) and the top 8 players with the highest combined scores across all eligible machines will qualify for the Sunday finals event where they could become the DEF CON Pinball Champion!</p>
<p>Achieving a high score may sound simple but pinball rulesets are very complex and the skill to complete a “Wizard Mode” or achieve a high score requires research, practice, knowledge and execution. Out of the box thinking, analytical skills and pattern recognition are traits that pinball players must exhibit to be successful and some games have rule sets that can be studied and exploited to achieve a high score. Hackers are at an advantage here and while this is just a pinball contest, we expect that the community is ready for this challenge!</p>
<p>Stern Pinball has prepared an exclusive DEF CON 33 digital badge that will be available for any attendee to earn for playing in this event. Additional DEF CON specific Insider Connect digital badges and prizes may be unlocked during game play.</p>
<h4>Participant Prerequisites</h4>
<p>No prerequisites are required but if tournament players wish to collect the DC33 digital badge or formally track high scores, registering for Stern Insider Connect is advised.</p>

<p class="abstract">In this game capture the flag you will be presented with real configurations of real wireless and radio technologies to attack.  Practice your skill and learn new ones from Radio Frequency IDentification (RFID) through Software Defined Radio (SDR) and up to Bluetooth and WiFi.  There may even be Infrared, if you have the eye for it.</p>
<p>RF Hackers Sanctuary is once again holding the Radio Frequency Capture the Flag (RFCTF) at DEF CON 32.  RFHS runs this game to teach security concepts and to give people a safe and legal way to practice attacks against new and old wireless technologies.</p>
<p>We cater to both those who are new to radio communications as well as to those who have been playing for a long time. We are looking for inexperienced players on up to the SIGINT secret squirrels to play our games. The RFCTF can be played with a little knowledge, a pen tester’s determination, and $0 to $$$$$ worth of special equipment.  Our virtual RFCTF can be played completely remotely without needing any specialized equipment at all, just using your web browser!  The key is to read the clues, determine the goal of each challenge, and have fun learning.</p>
<p>This game doesn’t let you sit still either, as there are numerous fox hunts, testing your skill in tracking various signals.  If running around the conference looking for WiFi, Bluetooth, or even a Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS) device sounds like fun, we are your source of a higher step count.</p>
<p>There will be clues everywhere, and we will provide periodic updates via discord and twitter. Make sure you pay attention to what’s happening at the RFCTF desk, #rfctf on our discord, on Twitter @rf_ctf, @rfhackers, and the interwebz, etc. If you have a question - ASK! We may or may not answer, at our discretion.</p>
<p>FOR THE NEW FOLKS
This contest is free and open to anyone and everyone.  You can sign up and start playing any time during the conference.  If you didn’t bring your wireless gear don’t worry, our virtual RFCTF environment is played over ssh or through a web browser.  It may help to have additional tools installed on your local machine, but it is not required.
Read the presentations at: <a href="https://rfhackers.com/resources">https://rfhackers.com/resources</a></p>
<p>Hybrid Fun
For DEF CON 32 we will be running in “Hybrid” mode.  That means we will have both a physical presence AND the virtual game running simultaneously.  All of the challenges we have perfected in the last 2 years in our virtual game will be up and running, available to anyone all over the world (including at the conference), entirely free.  In addition to the virtual challenges, we will also have a large number of “in person” only challenges, which do require valid conference admission.  These “in-person” only challenges will include our traditional fox hunts, hide and seeks, and king of the hill challenges.  Additionally, we will have many challenges which we simply haven’t had time or ability to virtualize.  Playing only the virtual game will severely limit the maximum available points which you can score, therefore don’t expect to place.  If you play virtual only, consider the game an opportunity to learn, practice, hone your skills, and still get on the scoreboard for bragging rights.  The virtual challenges which are available will have the same flags as the in-person challenges, allowing physical attendees the choice of hacking those challenges using either (or both) methods of access.</p>
<p>The text box isn't large enough.  Please email me for the full version.  Abbreviated version above for fun</p>
<h4>Participant Prerequisites</h4>
<ul>
<li>A minimum of a laptop with a web browser and internet connection is required. Additional wireless equipment is optional but can seriously help. </li>
<li>Everyone of all skill levels are welcome, our game is inviting and free to play.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Pre-Qualification</h4>
<p>None.  Anyone can drop in and play if they have a laptop and a web browser.</p>

<p class="abstract">Experience the ultimate test of cognitive prowess with Raitlin's Challenge, a sophisticated collection of visual puzzles presented annually at Defcon. This intellectually demanding journey pushes participants to their limits through increasingly complex challenges that require mastery of diverse knowledge domains.</p>
<p>The challenge begins with an initial puzzle that serves as a gateway to the main experience. Once solved, competitors gain access to a carefully curated series of visual puzzles presented in an artistically refined format. Each puzzle solved yields a verification string, allowing participants to track their progress through the challenge.</p>
<p>What sets Raitlin's Challenge apart is its comprehensive scope, drawing upon principles from mathematics, science, technology, cryptography, protocols, algorithms, biology, chemistry, programming, engineering, and ancient history. While technical expertise, particularly in hacking, proves advantageous, the true challenge lies in applying abstract thinking across multiple disciplines.</p>
<p>The journey to completion varies significantly among participants, spanning anywhere from days to years. Unlike many competitive events, Raitlin's Challenge maintains its availability beyond Defcon's conclusion, allowing determined individuals to pursue solutions at their own pace. Those who ultimately succeed earn recognition on the prestigious ledger of completions, joining an elite group of problem-solvers who have demonstrated exceptional intellectual versatility and persistence in unravelling the secrets of the Illuminati Party®.</p>

<p class="abstract">It's hard to tell what's real or not anymore. Deepfakes, AI, LLMs, Sora, unreliable sources of information, data spoofing... it's too much for even the most informed to keep up with, let alone the 99% of us just trying to get by. We're heading quickly to that precipice, close to that point of no return where those who control the money, the power, the GPUs, the energy grid, will control us all. Or worse: where the first artificial intelligences will manipulate us all... We're nearing a memory buffer overflow, a glitch in the matrix, a</p>
<p>/<em>`/$ REALI7Y OVERRUN $\'</em>\</p>
<p>Teams will join an interactive multiplayer video game and follow the storyline to clues that will give them hints about who they can trust and who they can't. The clues will follow the pattern of deepfakes and forgeries, asking players to figure out what's real and what's not, focusing on hacker and DefCon focus areas such as authentication, trust, social engineering, hardware and software manipulation and more. They will be given a rich story that will lead them to research the underlying issues in trust and anonymous trust systems. They will encounter challenges and tutorials on video and image validation and cryptographically safe messaging.</p>
<h4>Participant Prerequisites</h4>
<p>Laptop ideal. Tablet OK. Flagship phone possibly. We require no special knowledge to play, though to win, knowing a bit about general cryptographic concepts (private/public key authentication and signing), LLM-based services (ChatGPT, Dall-E) and DefCon trivia would help.</p>

 <img class="post-image scale" src="../../images/defcon-33/logos/contests/cnt-sevishing.webp" alt="logo for Social Engineering Community Vishing Competition (SECVC)" /> 

<p class="abstract">In this competition (#SECVC), teams go toe to toe by placing live vishing (voice phishing) phone calls in front of the Social Engineering Community audience at DEF CON. These calls showcase the duality of ease and complexity of the craft against the various levels of preparedness and defenses by actual companies. Teams can consist of 1-2 individuals  , which we hope allows for teams to utilize novel techniques to implement different Social Engineering tactics. Each team has limited time to place as many calls as possible from a soundproof booth. During that time, their goal is to elicit from the receiver as many objectives as possible. Whether you're an attacker, defender, business executive, or brand new to this community, you can learn by witnessing firsthand how easy it is for some competitors to schmooze their way to their goals and how well prepared some companies are to shut down those competitors! This competition takes place only on Friday in the Social Engineering Community village, be sure to get there early to get a seat; they fill up fast! </p>
<h4>Participant Prerequisites</h4>
<p>To successfully participate, selected competing teams need reliable internet access and a computer for the remote phase to conduct OSINT and research. For the onsite phase at DEF CON, participants must be present at the Social Engineering Community village, where all necessary equipment is provided. No prior vishing experience is required, but familiarity with social engineering techniques, OSINT gathering, and rapport-building skills can be beneficial. The competition is open to all skill levels, making it both educational and competitive. </p>
<h4>Pre-Qualification</h4>
<p>No, we do not. Unless you count opening up our “Call for Competitors” to select competing teams.</p>

<p class="abstract">The TeleChallenge might be the craziest experience you will ever have on your phone. We create a fully immersive virtual world, in which an epic battle of wits and skill is contained. While we do show up in the real world as well, reality is optional. The TeleChallenge is playable entirely on a touch tone phone. Tune in, turn on, and drop out.<br><br>

You'll have no context, no remote, and no TV guide. You won't know where you are, what you're doing, or what is real. How deep does the rabbit hole go? That largely depends on you. It's dangerous to go alone, so get your friends and family together in a calling circle bundle. Diverse perspectives are a great way to look around corners and avoid blind spots, but you'll need more than these alone. This is a very difficult contest, and is designed to be among the most challenging at DEF CON. Winning teams have always been serious and dedicated, but not necessarily experienced. One previous winning team was at their very first DEF CON!<br><br>

<em>Joining the TeleChallenge means you're joining an immersive experience. You may place and receive live and recorded calls as part of your participation.  The DEF CON Code of Conduct applies both to players and to the TeleChallenge, and the contest is rated PG-13.</em><br><br>

Where can you find us? Part of the Challenge is discovering the TeleChallenge. And don't forget to use promo code <strong>#MICHAELKEY</strong></p>
<h4>Participant Prerequisites</h4>
<p>Participants will need a touch tone phone which works with the TeleChallenge. Participants are encouraged to use the Phone Qualification Tool to ensure that their phones work correctly with our technology platform.</p>
<p>Participants are encouraged, but not required, to form a team of 3-5 people to play the TeleChallenge. For best success, contest creators recommend that teams contain a diverse set of knowledge, skills, and experience. </p>
<h4>Pre-Qualification</h4>
<p>We provide a Phone Qualification Tool to help contest participants ensure that their devices work correctly with our technology platform.</p>
<p>We have provided historical details, writeups and contest walkthroughs which may be useful for prospective contestants to review in order to be prepared for the TeleChallenge.</p>

<p class="abstract">warl0ck gam3z CTF is a hands-on 24/7 throw-down, 3 time black badge hacker competition, focusing on areas of physical security, digital forensics, hacker challenges and whatever craziness our exploit team develops. This is an online framework so participants can access it regardless of where they are or what network they are connected to via laptop, netbook, tablet or phone.</p>
<p>Most challenges require participants to download something that pertains to the problem at hand and solve the challenge using whatever tools, techniques or methods they have available.There are a multitude of point gainers on and off the game board. Extra point gainers will randomly appear on the game board in the form of The Judge, Bonus Questions, Free Tokens, One Time Tokens, Movie Trivia Quotes, Scavenger Hunts (online and onsite), Lock Picking (onsite) and Flash Challenges. Be careful of the 50/50 Token which may add or subtract points to your score.</p>
<p>The game board contains a scoring area so participants can view current standings. There is always on onsite/online moderator to assist participants that may be experiencing issues as well. All events highlights that occur on the game board are sent o to Twitter as they happen.  Additionally, our Facebook site will be populated with information regarding the challenge and the current state of events.</p>

<p class="details">
</p>

 <img class="post-image scale" src="../../images/defcon-33/logos/contests/cnt-whoseslide.webp" alt="logo for Whose Slide Is It Anyway?" /> 

<p class="abstract">“Whose Slide Is It Anyway?” is the unholy union of improv comedy, hacking, and slide deck sado-masochism. We are the embodiment of the hacker battle cry &quot;FUCK IT, WE'LL DO IT IN PROD.&quot;</p>
<p>Our team of slide monkeys will create a stupid amount of short slide decks on whatever nonsense tickles our fancies. Slides are not exclusive to technology, they can and will be about anything. Contestants will take the stage and choose a random number corresponding to a specific slide deck. They will then improvise a minimum 5 minute / maximum 10 minute lightning talk, becoming instant subject matter experts on whatever topic/stream of consciousness appears on the screen.</p>
<p>But....why?</p>
<p>Because for us, the stage is hallowed ground and since stupidity can't be stopped, we decided to weaponize it. Whether you delight in the chaos of watching your fellow hackers squirm or would like to sacrifice yourself to the Contest Gods, it’s a night of schadenfreude for the whole family.</p>
<h4>Participant Prerequisites</h4>
<p>A blatant and offensive disregard to any and all comfort zones to which one has heretofore been accustomed.  </p>
<h4>Pre-Qualification</h4>
<p>None.</p>
