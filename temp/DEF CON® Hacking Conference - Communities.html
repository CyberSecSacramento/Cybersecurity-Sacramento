<p class="abstract">It's finally here - a proper home for all things Badgelife on the con floor! This is our first year so bear with us, but we have big goals:  This year we'll be starting an effort to create the Badgelife Museum, a collection of current and former community-made badges, including SAO's, on display at con! Donate your own badges and SAOs you've made or collected to the museum, and see them come back to con year after year.. or bring what you've got to trade with the community via our &quot;take-one, leave-one&quot; SAO Trading Wall, or our in-person Badge Trading meetups!  If you're interested in making Badges or SAOs yourself, we will have lots of interesting badge creators around showing off their work and giving workshops or lightning talks on their methodologies. Come learn from the best and meet your favorite creators at our various Badgemaker Meetups!  Before and after con, you can find our Discord (and what will be our upcoming online Badge Archive) at http(s)://badge.life. Closer to con we'll post our schedule for any con workshops, talks or activities on the site as well, so check there for meetup times. Hope to see you at the community!</p><p></p>

<p class="abstract">DDoS attacks aren't just theoryâthey're an everyday grind for defenders. While the tech world throws around buzzwords and papers, we're here to talk real-world war stories, hands-on mitigation, and what actually works when the bits hit the fan.<br><br>

The DDoS Community at DEF CON is where defenders uniteâthrough talks, workshops, and contests that dive into evolving threats, busted botnets, and the clever tricks that keep services online.<br><br>

We're not just about packets and filtering. We hit the business, legal, and strategic angles tooâbecause the impact of DDoS goes way beyond the edge router.<br><br>

Come hang out, level up your defense game, and swap notes with folks who've been in the trenches. Whether you're a blue-teamer, researcher, or just DDoS-curious, there's a place for you here</p>

<p class="abstract">Ever see someone walking around DEF CON and wonder âwhat is up with the hard hats?â  The Hard Hat Brigade brings hackers together in the spirit of endless curiosity and tinkering. We use a common platform (hats) to combine art (bling) and hacker functionality (warez) to inspire others to explore outside of their comfort zones in a safe and welcoming community.  We encourage everyone to explore their creativity using art, electronics, mechanical design, or any other medium that piques their interest. Hats are inexpensive, widely available, and easy to modify to suit your needs. We started with hard hats but are not limited to any type of hat, so you have the freedom to choose whatever hat suits your fancy.  Despite everyone using a common platform, every creation is unique and embodies the personality of the creator. Walking around DEF CON, you can display your creation for all to see, and many will stop to ask you about what you have created. This allows you to talk about your experience, as well as inspire others to explore new ideas of their own.  One of the challenges at hacker summer camp has been finding people to connect with.  By leveraging hard hats as a canvas, HHB has solved this challenge with something that is incredibly accessible while also offering a ton of variety.  Gazing upon these creations, they reflect back the uniqueness of all the awesome hackers that weâve been able to meet.  In years past, weâve had the opportunity to see how so many talented and creative hackers tackle the challenge of using the venerable hard hat as their muse.  Just as fun, charming and skilled as so many attendees are, the hard hat has been a great vessel to carry their awesome projects.   Make your trip memorable by trying on a hat, learning and sharing building techniques, networking with other hat loving hackers, and expressing yourself in your own hacker way.  Keep on hacking!</p><p></p>

<p class="abstract">The Nix Community is celebrating its inaugural year at DEF CON this year! With help from a handful of the organizers and speakers at this year's Planet Nix, we're bringing a talented community of people who believe in Nix as the future of Linux system deployment to DEF CON. Nix is a declarative code as configuration ecosystem that makes it trivial to spin up VMs, containers, and isolated shell and build environments for anything. For the infosec community, it allows easy sharing of configurations across different teams for things like red team and blue team work, without needing to worry about containers. Think Docker on steroids written in a language that's JSON with functions with the largest Linux package ecosystem on planet earth, and you've got Nix.</p><p></p>

We're here for our 2nd year to celebrate where we came from, how computers and technology of yesteryear shaped our lives, and to show how the first generations of computers still have an impact on and a place in today's world. Rather than a stuffy collection of museum exhibits you can't touch or breathe on, our goal is to be fully interactive! We encourage the Defcon community to take part by bringing in working examples of old (or new but retro-inspired) technology to display, demonstrate, be passionate about, teach lessons on, and allow those who visit us to goof around with. We love to see people indulge their inner nostalgia nerd. Bring us your tired capacitors, your scratched cases, your huddled masses of cartridges and expansion cards yearning to see voltage again, the wretched refuse of your teeming e-waste pile, bring these the tempest-tost to us, we lift our 20A 120V circuits beside the golden door!  Walk-ins are welcome to long as you have a plan to store or bring it back home should we be out of display room :) Broken items are welcome as well - come start an impromptu repair party! We're confident that smart and inquiring minds will be around to help you solve issues, and we'll lend equipment where we can. Bring and show off your rare and weird vintage machines or retro consoles, or disks and cartridges of your favorite childhood games! All circuits are welcome here. Note: Due to staffing limitations, hours may fluctuate, but we will do our best to stay open for as much of con as we can. If you miss us, check back soon! If you wish to support our efforts, display something, or donate hardware, please coordinate with reanimationxp (at) gmail.com, subject &quot;Retro Tech Community&quot;!</p><p></p>

This room is a library vibes environment where people can calm down or recharge before going back out to experience more DEF CON, or even safely have a meltdown, stim, and take time to recenter. In our library area we will have fidget toys, coloring pages and more.  In our collaborative area we will be hosting birds of a feather conversations, small round table discussions, and more.<br><br>

Our reference desk can help you come up with a plan before going back out into DEF CON, if you would like. The reference desk will work to find and connect you with the amazing events and communities at the conference, as well as in the community at large, that are best suited to your interests.<br><br>

Finally, for those who find it hard to dive into something new alone, we will be offering small tour groups to take people around to various villages, contests and communities.</p>
