<h3>Venue FAQ</h3>
    
        
<p><strong>How much space will we have?</strong><br>
A lot. We will have all villages, contests, talks and events under one roof. To give you an idea the LVCC space will be about 800k square feet, and the old Caesars Convention Center was about 550k. Unfortunately a direct sqft comparison is not really the best way to measure space in a convention our size, especially given how complex and unique we are. We expect that you will notice the difference positively.  <br><br>

<strong>How will the conference be laid out?</strong><br>
We will know more on floor plan after we hold a couple on-site planning meetings in February and March. We will update our public maps on this page in the coming months, after coordinating with our content creators.<br><br>

<strong>What are the hours of DEF CON?</strong><br>
DEF CON cash registration &amp; official Merch store will open by 08:00 Thursday the 8th. We will open each day by 08:00, and close Thursday thru Saturday at 02:30. Sunday we will close after closing ceremonies, typically around 18:00. (Timezone is Pacific) <br><br>
 
<strong>What hotels should we stay in?</strong><br>
We currently have room blocks with <a href="https://book.passkey.com/go/RDCON">Venetian</a>, <a href="https://book.passkey.com/e/50911722">Sahara</a>, and <a href="https://book.passkey.com/go/DefCon2025FBLV">Fontainebleau</a> and we are working to add more hotels in the coming weeks. Please help us by booking at one of those hotels.<br><br>

<strong>Will new hotels charge a "resort fee" on top of quoted price and taxes? What is being offered to people that sign up under the new DEF CON block at the now hotels?</strong><br>
Each hotel will have separate pricing structures, resort fees, and wifi device limits, please refer to the hotel's registration page. As always we do negotiate on behalf of attendees to make room blocks more favorable.<br><br>
 
<strong>What about DCTV?</strong><br>
We are currently working the hotel venues to see what is possible, as each hotel has different infrastructure and we are just learning how to work with them. Once we know we will announce and update the hotels page.<br><br>

<strong>Where can I find a map that shows how we can enter and exit the Las Vegas Convention Center during DEF CON?</strong><br>
We are working towards adding more maps to this page. <br><br>

If you are taking a Taxi go to the West Convention Center entrance: 3150 Paradise Road<br>
You can find the current taxi fare at: <a href="https://www.lasvegashowto.com/taxi-fare">https://www.lasvegashowto.com/taxi-fare</a><br>
Currently the taxi cost from the airport to LVCC is speculated at $29.<br><br>

If you are walking to the LVCC you will enter via the West Convention Center entrance. You can enter by the north lobby or the main atrium entry doors. <br><br>

<strong>Are there any pedestrian bridges over streets to get to the convention center? Where?</strong><br>
Yes, and No. There is a sky bridge crossing paradise road from the north hall to the west hall, but it is really only useful to walk from one end of the LVCC to another. <br><br>

<strong>LAS VEGAS CONVENTION CENTER LOOP</strong> <br>
The Las Vegas Convention Center Loop is an underground transportation system designed to quickly transport passengers throughout the 200-acre Las Vegas Convention Center campus. The system consists of two one-way, .8-mile-long tunnels built to accommodate all-electric Tesla vehicles driving at speeds of up to 35 mph. The LVCC Loop reduces a 25-minute walk to a less than two-minute ride.<br><br>

<img class="scale" src="../../images/defcon-32/Loop_Map_Riviera_Map.webp" alt="Las Vegas monorail map image"  loading="lazy" decoding="async"/>   <br><br>

Attendees can access the LVCC Loop via three stations:<br>
â¢ West Station â Adjacent to West Hall, this station is located aboveground<br>
â¢ Central Station â Near the Central Hall Main Entrance, this station is located belowground and is accessible via escalator or elevator<br>

<img class="scale" src="../../images/defcon-32/lasvegas-convention-map.webp" alt="Las Vegas monorail map image"  loading="lazy" decoding="async"/>   <br><br>


<strong>Will there be any kind of shuttle service from the LVCC to strip hotels?</strong><br>
No<br><br>

<strong>What is the smoking policy at the LVCC?</strong><br>
Smoking is not allowed on the LVCC property, the existing outdoor terraces, or any  balconies. Marijuana &amp; tobacco vaping is 100% prohibited, there are uniformed officers with K9 on site trained to smell vaping.<br><br>

You will have to go outside completely to smoke. Smoking is allowed in the parking lots and sidewalks.<br><br>

<strong>Will DEF CON provide water stations again?</strong><br>
There are water fountains and modern bottle filling stations throughout all 3 floors of the con space. We will include bottle stations on our floor plan map once we have it uploaded to this page.  Remember to bring your bottles!<br><br>

<strong>Since we're going to be in one big non-casino space all day, will there still be Chill-out areas with areas to relax and refuel?</strong><br><br>
We will have several chill-outs for attendees to sit, rest, hack and or socialize.<br><br>
The LVCC West Hall has an exclusive food court for our use during the con.<br><br>
The food hall includes options from: Dunkin' Express, Metro Pizza, Brand Burgers &amp; Fries, Fancy Wok Asian Kitchen, Go Natural, The Roost Farm Fresh Chicken.<br><br>

<strong>Will there be a pool party?</strong><br>

<strong>Will the "Secure DEF CON Wifi Network" work the same way?</strong><br>
Rest assured that the DEF CON NOC will be on the job, and we have every intention of providing secure Wifi.<br><br>

DEF CON has a wonderful NOC team, what they do for us every year is nothing short of amazing. To learn more about the NOC please visit: <a href="https://noc.defcon.org/">https://noc.defcon.org/</a></p>

<h3>HEALTH &amp; PANDEMIC QUESTIONS</h3>
<p><strong>What health measures/protocols is DEF CON taking to ensure a safe environment on-site?</strong><br>

DEF CON is working closely with the venue to provide a safe and healthy experience for all. We will comply with whatever safety measures are required of us. <br><br>
<!--Click here for our full Covid 19 policy.-->

<strong>How's the air turnover in the LVCC?</strong><br>
The LVCC air filters have a quality rating of MERV 13 and they've increased replacement rate of air filters. The LVCC is also among the first convention centers in the nation to pursue the prestigious GBAC Star Accreditation Program, an accreditation that establishes gold standard cleaning, disinfection and infectious disease prevention protocols that meet or exceed the industry's highest standards of cleanliness for pathogens like the novel coronavirus.  <br><br>

<strong>What is your mask policy?</strong><br>
We will have masks on hand for anyone who needs them as well as a finite number of test kits onsite as well. There will be lists of resources for testing and treatment available in the program and at the Info Booth. Wearing a mask remains the safest option, but with these changes our policy is masks strongly recommended. <!--Click here for our fact sheet on masks.--> <br><br>

<strong>What will capacity look like?</strong><br>
Capacity is always set to be capped at each given space's fire code standard capacity. In case of changing health and safety recommendations, limits will be reviewed and revised at the direction of Southern Nevada Health District (SNHD) and there will be dedicated support onsite to ensure our policies are being followed.<br><br>

<strong>Will you have working elevators and escalators this time?</strong><br>
Yes, the LVCC has several banks of elevators and escalators. The Sahara has replaced all of it's elevators as well, everything is shiny.<br><br>

<strong>Do you have ADA or HDA Information?</strong><br>
The purpose of the Hackers With Disabilities HDA team is to make the DEF CON experience the best it can be within the scope and ability of the DEF CON staff. <br><br>

The DEF CON 32 HDA Guide will be published at the link below when the team receives new information.  <a href="https://defcon.org/html/links/dc-hda.html">https://defcon.org/html/links/dc-hda.html</a><br><br>

DEF CON and DEF CON HDA provide assistance on a best effort basis, however we cannot control the policies of the hotels, convention centers, or provide assistance outside of our areas of responsibility. All hotels are ADA accessible and have staff available to assist attendees before and during the convention. Registered service animals are welcomed by all hotels, and relief areas are provided. These areas are marked on the HDA maps. If you require assistance with hotel issues you may contact any DEF CON Goon, the DEF CON information desk, or the appropriate point of contact for the hotel.<br><br>
