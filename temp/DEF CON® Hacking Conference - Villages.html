<img class="post-image scale" src="../../images/defcon-33/logos/villages/vlg-adversary.webp" alt="logo for Adversary Village" />

<p class="abstract"></p><p>Adversary Village is a community initiative which primarily focuses on adversary simulation/emulation, purple teaming, and adversary tradecraft. The village covers offensive operations, threat/APT/ransomware simulation, breach and adversarial attack simulation, supply chain security, adversary tactics, research on nation-state-sponsored threat-actors, adversary intelligence, adversarial mindset, philosophy, and hacker survival skills.</p>
<p>The goal of the Adversary Village is to build an open security community for the researchers and organizations, who are putting together new means, methodologies towards the simulation-emulation of adversary tactics and collaboration. </p>
<p>Subsequent to feedback from past editions, Adversary Village shall focus on hosting hands-on deep technical workshops, live demonstrations, panel discussions and a ton of other hands-on activities on adversarial attack simulation/emulation, offensive tradecraft to engage and educate the community.
Adversary Village would have the following hands-on activities for this year at DEF CON;</p>
<p>Adversary simulator and purple teaming hands-on booth</p>
<p>Adversary Simulator booth is a volunteer assisted activity, which has hands-on adversary emulation plans and exercises specific to a wide variety of threat-actors; these are meant to provide the participants with a better understanding of adversarial attack emulation. The booth will be hosting a simulated environment meant to recreate enterprise infrastructure, operational technology environment, which serves targets for various attack simulations.
The hands-on simulator booth also hosts an activity, which would need the participants to generate their own adversary emulation plans to assess the efficacy of the defense systems based on publicly available cyber threat intelligence.</p>
<p>Choose-your-own-Adversary-Adventure Tabletop Game</p>
<p>Adversary adventure is a story-scenario based, interactive, cyber war-gaming, choose-your-own adventure model interactive game. This is a gamified version of table-top exercises which is presented to the participants as they can choose to play as an attacker, post exploitation OR a Defender who is defending against an attacker group-threat actor OR even play as a CISO who is dealing with an adversarial situation such as a ransomware incident.</p>
<p>Hands-on deep technical workshops</p>
<p>Adversary Village will feature a limited number of deep technical workshops focused on advanced adversary tradecraft and techniques. </p>
<p>Hands-on guided breach and offensive attack simulation exercises</p>
<p>This area will feature guided attack simulation exercises for participants to engage with. There will be a few scenario-focused activities, &quot;Breach-the-Hospital&quot;, &quot;Breach-the-Office&quot;, âBreach-the-Bankâ etc., visually represented by modular-brick-LEGO sets. A simulated cyber range will be available for each scenario, providing an exact replica of an enterprise production environment. We will provide a detailed walkthrough of the attack scenarios, including Tools-Techniques-and-Procedures, commands and how-to guides, demonstrating how to attack and breach the target environment.
This exercise will give participants a clear understanding of how threat actors infiltrate corporate environments. </p>
<p>Adversary Wars CTF</p>
<p>Adversary Village will be hosting &quot;Adversary Wars CTF&quot;, where the participants will have to pose as adversaries and replicate adversarial actions against each element of a âtargetâ organization. Adversary Wars would have real world challenge scenarios and challenges, where the participants can perform various attacks and learn new TTPs. To visualize the CTF environment, the contest area will feature a miniature model of the city made using interlocking-plastic-bricks. The breached components will be physically marked in the city model as the CTF progresses.
There will be prizes, complimentary hoodies (yes, the iconic adversary village hoodies), free t-shirts, cool stickers, village coins, badges, and various other swags.</p><p></p>

<p class="abstract"></p><p>The aviation and space industries, security researchers, and the public share a common goal: safe, reliable, and trustworthy aviation and space operations. For too long, negative perceptions and fractured trust on all sides have held back collaboration between the aviation, space, and security researcher communities that has advanced safety, reliability, and security of other industries. As the traditional domains of aviation safety and cybersecurity increasingly overlap, more effective collaboration between stakeholders ensures we will be safer, sooner, together.</p>
<p>Through the Aerospace Village, the security research community invites industry leaders, researchers and academia interested in aviation and space security, safety, and resilience to attend, understand, collaborate together to achieve our common goals. Empathy and understanding build common ground, while acts and words likely to increase division between these two communities undermine these efforts. The Aerospace Village welcomes those who seek to improve aviation and space security, safety, and resilience through positive, productive collaboration among all ecosystem stakeholders.</p>
<p>Our Goal</p>
<p>The Aerospace Village is a volunteer team of hackers, pilots, and policy advisors who come from the public and private sectors. We believe the flying public deserves safe, reliable, and trustworthy air travel which is highly dependent on secure aviation and space operations.</p><p></p>

<p class="abstract"></p><p>Join us at the AI Village for interactive demonstrations at the intersection of AI and security. Weâve got something new this year with a full purple team demonstration from the AI Cyber League. </p>
<p>For the third Generative Red Team we are going to âred teamâ the evaluations that establish a modelâs performance. We are bringing several model systems built to do different tasks each with their own model card. These model cards will define uses and restrictions the model creators want and determine what we mean by âtrustâ when it comes to fuzzier concepts like âcan write good Rustâ and âdoesnât help you hackâ. This model card will be built off of open source evaluations that prove and establish how effective the model is. We will be paying bounties for findings against the evaluations that the model cards used to make their claims.</p>
<p>Following the success of last year's real-time deepfake demonstrations, we're taking things to the next level. This year, we're showcasing five different deepfake systems across a spectrum of computational requirements â from high-end professional setups to consumer-grade hardware that's becoming increasingly accessible. You can see how detections we have will break down as compute per dollar keeps improving.</p><p></p>

After a big success and great feedback during the first ever Bug Bounty Village during DEFCON 32,  We want to be part of DEFCON 33 and keep celebrating the bug bounty community, where hunters, learners, and enthusiasts can converge, interact with top-tier hackers, attend insightful workshops, talks, and immerse themselves in hands-on activities.</p>
<p>With over 20 workshops, panels and talks, the Bug Bounty Village at DEFCON 32 was a huge success. The room was completely full of hackers at all times, Some of the best bug bounty hunters in the community were part of our village to share knowledge, create content, teach others, and also, to make new friends. With waiting lines of over 100 people waiting to get in for some of our workshops, we have demonstrated that there is a huge interest in Bug Bounty to remain as a specific village at DEFCON, and have that special place in the biggest hacker conference in the world, where the Bug Bounty community can connect, grow and help others become the future of Bug Bounty.</p><p></p>

<img class="post-image scale" src="../../images/defcon-33/logos/villages/villages-example.webp" alt="placeholder logo" />

<p class="abstract"></p><p>The Maritime Hacking Village (MHV) has set sail for LVCC to deliver the first and only immersive maritime hacking experience for you to learn what it takes to exploit and defend real-world maritime systems. Our mission is simple: we are creating a space for stakeholders to come together and navigate the changing tides in the maritime sectorâs technological, geopolitical, and adversarial landscapes which demand ever-more-urgent collective action to address the systemic cybersecurity vulnerabilities in the systems which underpin global maritime defense and trade. Together we hack to facilitate the discovery and sharing of knowledge integral to the development of effective maritime cybersecurity policy, industry standards and regulations, vulnerability information sharing, cyber threat intelligence, and most importantly â a capable and trusted workforce and community-of-interest. </p>
<p>Why? Maritime infrastructure is the backbone of the global economy and order. Countries, companies, and militaries all use the sea for power projection and commerce, but no single stakeholder controls the implementation of policies and regulations. Stakeholders unanimously agree that from machines, to systems, to governance, the maritime domain is fundamentally insecure. Still, seemingly insurmountable access barriers are preventing the security community, and anyone else, from doing anything to help.</p>
<p>MHV has made it our purpose to eliminate these barriers â and to provide every human with the access and resources necessary to engage in maritime vulnerability research and cybersecurity innovation. Our village is a safe, shared space where the security community (elite hackers, trusted providers, and young talent alike) can develop and demonstrate their competence in attacking and defending real maritime systems â and where maritime industry stakeholders can engage with this community on neutral ground to grow their arsenals of knowledge, tools, trusted and capable providers, and fresh talent. We believe that this work together will create rising tides of awareness, information sharing, and innovation that will lift all ships and allow us to gradually secure the maritime sector.</p><p></p>

<p class="abstract"></p><p>The Social Engineering Community is formed by a group of individuals who have a passion to enable people of all ages and backgrounds interested in Social Engineering with a venue to learn, discuss, and practice this craft. We plan to use this opportunity at DEF CON to present a community space that offers those elements through panels, research opportunities, and contests in order to act as a catalyst to foster discussion, advance the craft and create a space for individuals to expand their network. DEF CON attendees can either participate in these events, or they can watch the events unfold and learn about Social Engineering as an audience member. We plan to accomplish the above by bringing together passionate individuals to have a shared stake in building this community.</p><p></p>

<p class="abstract"></p><p>The <a href="https://votingvillage.org">Voting Village</a> has been an annual event since 2017 that provides hands-on opportunities to understand and analyze voting system hardware and software.  Before the Voting Village, ordinary technologists and citizens had no access to the systems that run our election infrastructure. As the only open environment that gives the public hands-on access to their election systems, it is a critical antidote to rampant misinformation about election security and provides an opportunity to strengthen these systems against malicious attacks. The Voting Village is brought to you by our 501(c)3 tax exempt not for profit organization, the Election Integrity Foundation, EIN: 83-4089169. </p>
<p>The Voting Village has been invited to testify to Congress several times about how to strengthen election infrastructure. Conversely, we have drawn fire from voting system manufacturers, prompting a bipartisan group of senators to co-sign a public letter defending the Voting Village against some of the largest voting machine companies in 2018. </p>
<p>Even between presidential election cycles, expanding the reach of the Voting Village and providing education about how our election systems work is critical to democracy.</p><p></p>
